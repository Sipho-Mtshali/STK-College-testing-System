# ✅ Firebase Configuration Complete!

## 🎉 What Was Done

### 1. Firebase Credentials Updated
Your Firebase project credentials have been integrated into the system:

**File Updated**: `js/firebase-config.js`

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyC8m_iv91L2EUEc6Xsg5DJHGWTdfUcxGZY",
    authDomain: "edutech-system.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "edutech-system",
    storageBucket: "edutech-system.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "1072073327476",
    appId: "1:1072073327476:web:5fdd0c76218a3a772ca221",
    measurementId: "G-6M9540ZEPE"
};
```

### 2. Google Sign-In Enhanced ✨

**File Updated**: `js/auth.js`

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Automatic Account Creation**: New users signing in with Google automatically get an account
- ✅ **Seamless Experience**: No need to register separately
- ✅ **Smart Role Assignment**: New Google users are automatically assigned "student" role
- ✅ **Existing User Support**: Recognizes returning users and logs them in directly
- ✅ **Profile Integration**: Pulls name and photo from Google profile

**How It Works:**

1. **First Time Google Sign-In (New User)**:
   - User clicks "Continue with Google"
   - Selects Google account
   - System creates new user profile automatically
   - Assigns Student ID (e.g., STU123456)
   - Sets role as "student"
   - Creates student data collection
   - Redirects to student dashboard
   - ✨ **No registration form needed!**

2. **Returning Google Sign-In (Existing User)**:
   - User clicks "Continue with Google"
   - Selects Google account
   - System recognizes existing user
   - Updates last login timestamp
   - Redirects to appropriate dashboard (student/facilitator/admin)

### 3. Security Rules Optimized

**File Updated**: `firestore.rules`

Added helper function for better performance and security:
```javascript
function isOwner(userId) {
    return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```
